First lets start off with for iv in pairs so heres an example!


```
for i, v in pairs(game:GetService("workspace"):GetChildren()) do
    v.Anchored = false
end
```
As you may see the map falls apart how fun is that

You can do many cool stuff with it just like this

Now since you should understand iv in pairs its time for a challenge

Make the entire map or a certaint object or a few certaint objects change size and position each second

Now since you're done with that its time for a diffrent subject
